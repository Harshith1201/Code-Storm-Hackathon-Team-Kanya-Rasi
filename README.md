> A smarter, safer, and more trustworthy blood donation & transfusion ecosystem for India.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

India’s blood supply chain faces life-threatening issues:

- **Unsafe Transfusions**: Expired, mismatched, or pathogen‑contaminated blood.  
- **Lack of Traceability**: No accountability or audit trail, enabling fake agents.  
- **Low Donor Retention**: Lack of engagement, feedback, or recognition.

---

## 💡 Our Solution: TransfuseSafe

**TransfuseSafe** is a two‑part system tackling these problems with technology:

1. **Donor & Recipient App**  
   - Connects donors with recipients in need.  
   - Tracks donor eligibility cycles.  
   - Provides rewards to incentivize consistent donation.

2. **QR Safety Verification App for Hospitals**  
   - Verifies blood‑packet integrity via encrypted QR codes.  
   - Prevents unsafe transfusions and ensures traceability.
